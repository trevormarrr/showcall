# ShowCall v2.4.2 Release Notes

## 🎨 UI Enhancement Release

### What's New

- ✅ **Taller Cue Items** - 50% larger cue items (72px min-height) for much better readability
- ✅ **Enhanced Scrollbar** - Always visible, polished scrollbar with beautiful gradient effects
- ✅ **Better Spacing** - Increased padding (18px/20px) and gaps (10px) throughout
- ✅ **Larger Elements** - Bigger cue numbers (40px), text sizes, and color indicators
- ✅ **Smooth Auto-Centering** - Active cue smoothly scrolls to center of viewport
- ✅ **Improved Container** - Expanded to 65vh with 350px minimum height
