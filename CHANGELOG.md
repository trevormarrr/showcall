# Changelog

All notable changes to ShowCall will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Presets editor (UI ‚Üí Presets) allowing editing of preset labels, hotkeys, colors, and macro steps. Saved to user profile as `presets.json`.
- Settings modal (UI ‚Üí Settings) to change Resolume IP/ports and ShowCall server port. Saving persists to user `.env` and restarts the server.
- Update check button (Quick Actions) that queries GitHub Releases and opens the latest installer for your platform.
- New server endpoints:
	- `GET/POST /api/presets` for presets persistence.
	- `GET/POST /api/settings` for configuration.
	- `GET /api/update/check` for latest release/asset URLs.

### Changed
- Server converted to ESM module (`server.mjs`) and unpacked for production to ensure reliable startup inside packaged apps.
- Improved UI grid and labels (Layers shown as ‚ÄúLayer N‚Äù), visual polish for deck and quick cues.

### Fixed
- Packaged app startup reliability across dist vs installed contexts (robust path resolution and spawn env).
- Better error handling/logging for OSC/REST operations.

### Notes
- Ensure Resolume REST API and OSC input are enabled (default ports 8080 and 7000).
- On first run, user settings are created under the platform user data directory (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ShowCall`).
- Auto‚Äëupdate currently opens the latest release asset in your browser; seamless in‚Äëapp updates may be added later.
