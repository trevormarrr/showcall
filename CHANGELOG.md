# Changelog

All notable changes to ShowCall will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- **Pop-out Preset Deck Window**: New floating window for preset buttons that stays always-on-top
  - Access via "ü™ü Pop-out Deck" button in the main UI header
  - Compact 300x600px window optimized for quick preset access
  - Fully functional preset buttons with keyboard shortcuts
  - Always-on-top behavior for use alongside other applications (like ProPresenter)
  - Fallback to new browser tab when running in web mode
- IPC communication system for Electron main/renderer process coordination
- Dedicated deck.html page with responsive preset button layout

### Technical Changes
- Added `electron/preload.js` for secure IPC communication
- Extended `electron/main.cjs` with `createDeckWindow()` function and IPC handlers
- Enhanced main window with preload script for deck window communication
- New deck UI with hover effects, keyboard shortcut indicators, and visual feedback

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Enhanced active clip highlighting system that shows ALL active clips in a column (not just the top layer)
- Right-click foundation for future preview functionality
- Improved notification stacking with proper vertical spacing

### Changed
- Removed individual "PROG" text badges from clips for cleaner UI - now uses border highlighting only
- Removed layer label highlighting on left side (columns-only highlighting approach)
- Multi-clip detection via programClips array to handle multiple layers active in same column
- Stronger CSS borders and glow effects for better visibility

### Fixed
- Visual feedback issue where only the top layer showed as active when multiple layers in the same column were live
- Notification overlap and stacking problems in top-right corner

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Presets editor (UI ‚Üí Presets) allowing editing of preset labels, hotkeys, colors, and macro steps. Saved to user profile as `presets.json`.
- Settings modal (UI ‚Üí Settings) to change Resolume IP/ports and ShowCall server port. Saving persists to user `.env` and restarts the server.
- Update check button (Quick Actions) that queries GitHub Releases and opens the latest installer for your platform.
- New server endpoints:
	- `GET/POST /api/presets` for presets persistence.
	- `GET/POST /api/settings` for configuration.
	- `GET /api/update/check` for latest release/asset URLs.

### Changed
- Server converted to ESM module (`server.mjs`) and unpacked for production to ensure reliable startup inside packaged apps.
- Improved UI grid and labels (Layers shown as ‚ÄúLayer N‚Äù), visual polish for deck and quick cues.

### Fixed
- Packaged app startup reliability across dist vs installed contexts (robust path resolution and spawn env).
- Better error handling/logging for OSC/REST operations.

### Notes
- Ensure Resolume REST API and OSC input are enabled (default ports 8080 and 7000).
- On first run, user settings are created under the platform user data directory (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ShowCall`).
- Auto‚Äëupdate currently opens the latest release asset in your browser; seamless in‚Äëapp updates may be added later.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Live Indicators panel showing current Program and Preview clip with layer + column badges.
- Column-wide and layer label contextual highlighting for active Program and Preview clips.
- Subtle sibling column highlighting to improve spatial awareness without overwhelming contrast.

### Changed
- Grid status update now unifies highlight clearing and applies consistent CSS classes.

### Notes
- No server/API changes; purely frontend enhancements (safe upgrade). If custom CSS overrides existed, verify new classes: `active-col-highlight`, `active-layer-highlight`, `col-sibling-prog`, `col-sibling-prev`.
